It’s comprehensive and, for just a few dollars a day, one of the best investments you can get for a trip.

Insurance was there when I had to replace my camera and when I popped an eardrum scuba diving! Get it!',

On top of that, it’s very easy to create fake reviews and make a place seem better than it is. Many hotels and restaurants hire firms to artificially inflate their reviews on the platform. Additionally, TripAdvisor has been known to take down reviews that are overly negative as well as reviews on sexual assault. Use TripAdvisor with caution. Or better yet, don’t use it at all.',
